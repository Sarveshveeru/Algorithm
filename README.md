# Pokemon Data Story telling and Data Visualisation
Countless items of merchandise, trading cards, television shows, movies, and video games all fall under the umbrella of the Pokémon media property. The Pokémon franchise is set in a shared reality where humans and a wide range of species with special abilities known as Pokémon coexist. Three main objectives define the Pokémon universe. The first is to venture out and discover new places. The second is to locate and capture a single Pokémon of each species. The third option is to train a small squad of Pokémon from those you've captured and use them in battles against other players' Pokémon. Although all ages are known to be drawn to the series, its target demographic is boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 12[1].
